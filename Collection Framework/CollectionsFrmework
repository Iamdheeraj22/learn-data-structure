Collection :- a collection represent the group of objects.

    Collection in java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.

    collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching , sorting , insertion , manipulation & deletion.

    Java Collection means a single unit of objects. 
    
    Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).

      
    
    Collection :-

         interface :- 
                    :- List
                        :-classes

                            :- ArrayList
                            :- LinkedList
                            :- Vector

                                extends :-
                                        Stack
                    :- Queue
                         
                        classes :-
                              :- Deque(interface)
                                  :-arrayQueue(implements(class))
                            
                        PriorityQueue(implements in Queue(class))

                    :- Set

                        :- HashSet(class)
                        :- LinkedHashSet(class)

                        :- SortedSet(interface)

                             :- TreeSet(class)


framework :- 
    
    :- it's provides the reaymade architecture
    :- it represent a Set of classes & interfaces
    :- it is optional

Collection framework :- 
 
     collection framework represent unified architecture for sorting & manipulate a group of objects.


         it is has 
             
             :- interfaces & it's implementations , classes
             :- algorithm


   
    Methods of the collection framework :-


         :- public boolean add(Element e)
         :- public boolean addall(Collection<? extends E> c)
         :- public boolean remove(object element)
         :- public boolean removeall(Collection<?> c)
         :- public boolean removeif(Predicate <? super E> Fillter)
         :- public int sise()
         :- public void clear()
         :- public boolean contains(object element)
         :- public boolean containsall(Collection<?> c)
         :- public Iterator itretor();
         :- public object[] toarray()
         :- public boolean isEmpty()
         :- public boolean equals()
         :- public int hashCode()
